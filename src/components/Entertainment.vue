        YouTube is a simple video platform that comes at no individual cost. It has a wide variety of genres; 
        on YouTube you can learn a new skill, watch people cook, listen to music, and much more. Searching for specific 
        videos and general browsing are both simple and easy. The YouTube homepage is a great place to start! <br/>
        <img src="../images_entertainment/yt_homepage.png"/> <br/>
        The videos immediately visible are YouTube's recommendations for you. On the lefthand side are categories to help you browse:
        specific topics will appear, and clicking on them will allow you to browse popular videos in those categories. The trending tab 
        will show you the most popular videos currently circulating YouTube. Now, let's take a look at the search function. <br/>
        <img src="../images_entertainment/yt_search.png"/> <br/>
        Note that the categories from the homepage are there even when you make a specific search. Here, I performed a search for 
        "cat videos". The results youtube provided me are the most relevant videos that match my search input. However, there are
        ways to make our search even more specific! Clicking the filter button near the top will bring us to the following drop-down
        menu: <br/>
        <img src="../images_entertainment/yt_filter.png"/> <br/>
        Through this feature, we can select any of the listed attributes and apply them to our search. For example, if I want to watch
        a cat video, but I don"t have a lot of time, I would make this search, click "filter", and under duration select "short". <br/>
        What if something goes wrong? In general, the first thing to do is reload the page. You can also try disconnecting and reconnecting 
        to your WiFi. If this doesn't work, we have two main options:
        search "YouTube troubleshooting" in google for general help, or google specifically what is going wrong. Generally, the best 
        results for this are from "support.google.com" or directly from YouTube.

      <v-expansion-panel-header>Which Streaming Service is for Me?</v-expansion-panel-header>
      <v-expansion-panel-content>
        The world of video streaming services is very expansive; we have plenty of options. Unfortunately, this means we have a lot of 
        information to parse through. Here, we will go through the most common streaming services, and what they are known for. To start, 
        let's look at Netflix.
        Netflix was the first of its kind. It has a very wide selection of TV and movies with no particular niche. A standard Netflix 
        subscription comes without advertisements during and between epsiodes or movies. Netflix releases TV shows in full seasons, so it 
        is not the best choice for watching new shows as they air. The service is also gaining a reputation in production. "Netflix Originals"
        are like the rest of the platform: wide-ranging. From drama, to documentaries, to reality television, Netflix has a wide range. Overall,
        Netflix is a great general option, but lacks in the ways of live TV. <br/>
        Now, we will look at Hulu. The standard subscription of Hulu comes with access to some of their titles, with ads in between and during 
        movies and tv. Hulu drops TV episodes as they come out; if a show releases new epsiodes on cable every Wednesday, Hulu will drop that
        episode on Thursday. Hulu can be enhanced with channel extensions and Hulu+Live TV. The former allows you access to titles from a 
        specific channel, like HBO or Starz. The latter allows you access to more of Hulu's library and access to TV episodes live as they air 
        on cable. "Ad Free" Hulu is another extension that you can purchase that will stop ads from playing between and during your titles. Hulu
        is great for new shows, but to gain access to more of what the service has to offer, you will have to pay for extensions. <br/>
        Next up: Disney+. The advantage of Disney+ is simple: the titles available are the titles Disney owns. This means classic Disney, Marvel,
        Pixar, National Geographic, and -my personal favorite- Star Wars. These are the only titles on Disney+, but their reach is expansive. In 
        short, Disney+ is good for Disney content. <br/>
        Finally, we will look at ESPN+. This service is very similar to Disney+ in that it has a very specific title selection: sports. You can stream 
        games live and play them back later. <br/>
        Streaming services all function in basically the same way: you need an internet connection to access the titles. Now, what if something goes 
        wrong here? The approach is largely similar to YouTube, in that that the first thing to do is reload the page, and potientially disconnecting and
        reconnecting to your WiFi. If these options do not work, google search "[name of streaming service] troubleshooting" or directly search your specific 
        problem. Again, your best approach is probably finding help directly from the streaming service's help site.
